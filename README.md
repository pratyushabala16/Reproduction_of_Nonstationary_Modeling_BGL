#Review and Reproduction of ‘Nonstationary Modeling with Sparsity for Spatial Data via the Basis Graphical Lasso’:


## Regarding the reproduction -
* Exploration of the theory of non-stationarity in the use of Basis Graphical Lasso in modern spatial models.
* Independently replication of essential codes to reproduce the graphical plots and execute the MCMC run.

Plots generated from the reproduction of the corresponding paper.
